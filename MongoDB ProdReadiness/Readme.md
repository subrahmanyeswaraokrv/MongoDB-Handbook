# MongoDB Production Readiness Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist to ensure your MongoDB deployment is production-ready. It covers best practices in configuration, security, performance, and operational reliability.

---

## ✅ Deployment Architecture

- [x] MongoDB version is stable and supported (e.g., MongoDB 6.0+ or 8.0+).
- [x] Replica Set is configured for high availability (3+ nodes, odd number).
- [x] Arbiter used only when necessary (e.g., in 2-node deployments).
- [x] Storage engine: **WiredTiger**.
- [x] Journaling is enabled.
- [x] Data and logs are stored on separate disks or partitions.
- [x] Disk IOPS and network bandwidth are sufficient for workload.

## ✅ Security

- [x] Authentication and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** are enabled.
- [x] TLS/SSL enabled for in-transit encryption.
- [x] Encrypted storage or file system encryption in place.
- [x] IP whitelisting or VPC security groups configured.
- [x] MongoDB is not exposed to 0.0.0.0 without firewall/IP access control.
- [x] Password policy enforced (expiration/rotation every 90 days).
- [x] Audit logging enabled (optional but recommended).
- [x] No default users or roles left unchanged.

## ✅ Performance & Data Design

- [x] Data modeling optimized (Embed vs Reference based on access patterns).
- [x] Document size < 16MB.
- [x] No unbounded arrays or growing documents.
- [x] Indexes aligned with query patterns.
- [x] Compound indexes used where necessary.
- [x] Unused indexes removed.
- [x] TTL or capped collections for logs/expiring data.

## ✅ Query & Application Access

- [x] Query performance reviewed using `explain()`.
- [x] Covered queries implemented where possible.
- [x] Pagination implemented using range-based strategies (not skip/limit).
- [x] Application uses retryable writes and proper error handling.

## ✅ Backup & Disaster Recovery

- [x] Daily full backups and hourly incremental (Oplog-based) backups configured.
- [x] Backups are tested for restore validity.
- [x] PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) enabled (if applicable).
- [x] Backups stored in multiple locations (e.g., local + S3).
- [x] Backup retention policy applied (e.g., 7-day local, 90-day S3).
- [x] Disaster Recovery (DR) site configured and tested.

## ✅ Monitoring & Alerts

- [x] Monitoring tools in place (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Ops Manager, Cloud Manager).
- [x] Alerts configured for key metrics:
  - Replication lag
  - Disk usage
  - Memory/CPU usage
  - Slow queries
  - Node availability
- [x] Log rotation configured.
- [x] Metrics and logs retained based on policy.

## ✅ Maintenance & Automation

- [x] Automated scripts for:
  - Backup
  - Restore
  - Password rotation
  - Index maintenance
- [x] Maintenance windows planned and approved.
- [x] Upgrades tested in staging before production rollout.
