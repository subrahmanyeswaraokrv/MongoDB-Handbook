### Steps to verify if a member is out of sync

In MongoDB Atlas, replica set members are fully managed, so you cannot manually resync a member like in a self-managed setup. 
However, if a member is out of sync, hereâ€™s what you can do:

1. Check Cluster Health
Go to the MongoDB Atlas UI.
Select your Cluster.
Navigate to the Metrics tab to monitor the replication lag and node status.
2. Restart the Out-of-Sync Node
MongoDB Atlas automatically detects lagging members and may restart them. However, you can manually trigger a failover:

Go to Cluster > Primary Node.
Click "Test Failover" (this forces an election and may help sync the lagging node).
3. Scale Up or Optimize Resources
If the node is lagging due to insufficient resources:

Upgrade the cluster tier to improve performance.
Check network latency between nodes.
4. Contact MongoDB Atlas Support
If a node remains out of sync:

Open a support ticket in the Atlas UI.
MongoDB support can investigate and resync the node.
Since MongoDB Atlas is fully managed, manual intervention is limited, and the system handles resyncing automatically.
