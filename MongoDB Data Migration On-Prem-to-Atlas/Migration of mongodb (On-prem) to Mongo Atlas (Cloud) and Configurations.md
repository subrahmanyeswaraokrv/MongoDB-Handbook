## Data Migration from On-Prem Server to Atlas

There are two methods for data migration from on-prem to Atlas:

### Live Migration

Atlas performs a live migration, keeping your source replica set in sync until you cut over to the Atlas cluster.

### Mongo Mirror

Mongo Mirror helps migrate data using a private endpoint. The tool is easy to set up and perform migration between on-prem and Atlas clusters.

For example, use the following command to migrate data:
```bash
mongomirror --host "sourceReplicaSet/azrxxx.yyyy.azr.zzz.com:27017" --username 'admin' --password 'password' --destination "atlasReplicaSet/pl-1-westeurope-azure"
