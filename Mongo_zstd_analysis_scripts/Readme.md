MongoDB Compression: Zstandard (zstd) vs Snappy
This document provides an overview of the two popular compression algorithms supported by MongoDB for data storage: Zstandard (zstd) and Snappy. It highlights their benefits, performance characteristics, and typical scenarios where each is most effective.

Overview
MongoDB supports configurable compression for data files to reduce disk space usage and improve I/O efficiency. The two common compression options are:

Snappy (default before MongoDB 4.2)

Zstandard (zstd) (available from MongoDB 4.2 onward)

Snappy Compression
What is Snappy?
Snappy is a fast compression and decompression algorithm developed by Google. It focuses on very high speed with reasonable compression ratios.

Benefits
Very fast compression and decompression speeds — ideal for low CPU overhead.

Minimal latency impact on database operations.

Good enough compression ratio for many workloads.

Widely tested and stable in MongoDB environments.

Use Cases
Workloads sensitive to CPU usage: When you want compression but cannot afford significant CPU load.

High throughput OLTP systems: Where fast reads and writes dominate.

Environments with slower CPUs or limited resources.

Zstandard (zstd) Compression
What is Zstandard?
Zstandard is a newer compression algorithm by Facebook that offers better compression ratios and configurable compression levels, balancing speed and size.

Benefits
Higher compression ratios compared to Snappy — reduces disk storage significantly.

Configurable compression levels (from 1 [fastest] to 22 [maximum compression]).

Decompression speed still remains very fast.

Better for reducing I/O bandwidth and storage costs.

Supported for WiredTiger storage engine starting MongoDB 4.2.

Use Cases
Disk space-sensitive deployments: Where storage savings are a priority.

Read-heavy workloads: Where reduced storage means faster disk I/O.

Environments with sufficient CPU resources to handle higher compression overhead.

Backup and archival scenarios: Where compression ratio is more important than compression speed.

Comparison Summary
Feature	Snappy	Zstandard (zstd)
Compression Speed	Very fast	Fast (configurable)
Decompression Speed	Very fast	Very fast
Compression Ratio	Moderate	High
CPU Usage	Low	Moderate to high (configurable)
Storage Savings	Moderate	Significant
MongoDB Default	Before 4.2	4.2 and later
Best for	Low CPU overhead, high throughput	Disk space saving, read-heavy workloads

How to Choose?
Use Snappy if you want fast compression with minimal CPU overhead and are okay with moderate storage savings.

Use Zstandard if you want to save disk space significantly and have CPU resources to handle slightly higher compression workloads.

Enabling Compression in MongoDB
To enable compression in WiredTiger storage engine:

yaml
Copy
Edit
storage:
  wiredTiger:
    engineConfig:
      configString: "block_compressor=zstd"
or for Snappy:

yaml
Copy
Edit
storage:
  wiredTiger:
    engineConfig:
      configString: "block_compressor=snappy"
